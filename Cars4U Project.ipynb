    "# Background & Context\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a huge demand for used cars in the Indian Market today. As sales of new cars have slowed down in the recent past, the pre-owned car market has continued to grow over the past years and is larger than the new car market now. Cars4U is a budding tech start-up that aims to find footholes in this market.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2018-19, while new car sales were recorded at 3.6 million units, around 4 million second-hand cars were bought and sold. There is a slowdown in new car sales and that could mean that the demand is shifting towards the pre-owned market. In fact, some car sellers replace their old cars with pre-owned cars instead of buying new ones. Unlike new cars, where price and supply are fairly deterministic and managed by OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturer / except for dealership level discounts which come into play only in the last stage of the customer journey), used cars are very different beasts with huge uncertainty in both pricing and supply. Keeping this in mind, the pricing scheme of these used cars becomes important in order to grow in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a senior data scientist at Cars4U, you have to come up with a pricing model that can effectively predict the price of used cars and can help the business in devising profitable strategies using differential pricing. For example, if the business knows the market price, it will never sell anything below it. \n",

    "1. S.No. clearly has no interpretation here but as discussed earlier let us drop it only after having looked at the initial linear model.\n",
    "2. Kilometers_Driven values have an incredibly high range. We should check a few of the extreme values to get a sense of the data.\n",
    "3. Minimum and maximum number of seats in the car also warrent a quick check. On an average a car seems to have 5 seats, which is about right.\n",
    "4. We have used cars being sold at less than a lakh rupees and as high as 160 lakh, as we saw for Lamborghini earlier. We might have to drop some of these outliers to build a robust model.\n",
    "5. Min Mileage being 0 is also concerning, we'll have to check what is going on.\n",
    "6. Engine and Power mean and median values are not very different. Only someone with more domain knowledge would be able to comment furthur on these attributes.\n",
    "7. New price range seems right. We have both budget friendly Maruti cars and Lamborghinis in our stock. Mean being twice that of the median suggests that there are only a few very high range brands, which again makes sense."

    "1. With our linear regression model we have been able to capture ~90 variation in our data.\n",

    "    - The year of manufacturing\n",
    "    - Number of seats in the car\n",
    "    - Power of the engine\n",
    "    - Mileage\n",

    "    - Car Category - budget brand to ultra luxury\n",
    "    The p-values for these predictors are <0.05 in our final model \n",
    "3. Newer cars sell for higher prices. 1 unit increase in the year of manufacture leads to [ exp(0.1170) = 1.12 Lakh ] increase in the price of the vehicle, when everything else is constant.\n",
    "It is important to note here that the predicted values are log(price) and therefore coefficients have to converted accordingly to understand that influence in Price.\n",
    "4. As the number of seats increases, the price of the car increases - exp(0.0343) = 1.03 Lakhs\n",
    "5. Mileage is inversely correlated with Price. Generally, high Mileage cars are the lower budget cars.\n",
    "It is important to note here that correlation is not equal to causation. That is to say that increase in Mileage does not lead to a drop in prices. It can be understood in such a way that the cars with high mileage do not have a high power engine and therefore have low prices.\n",
    "6. Kilometers Driven have a negative relationship with the price which is intuitive. A car that has been driven more will have more wear and tear and hence sell at a lower price, everything else being 0.\n",
    "7. The categorical variables are a little hard to interpret. But it can be seen that all the car_category variables in the dataset have a positive relationship with the Price and the magnitude of this positive relationship increases as the brand category moves to the luxury brands. It will not be incorrect to interpret that the dropped car_category variable for budget friendly cars would have a negative relationship with the price (because the other 3 are increasingly positive.)"
